# Eternum Storacha Mirror

This repository hosts the Storacha-bound metadata mirrors for Eternum's decentralized logs.  
Each folder contains a unique signal pair, UCAN metadata, and cryptographically timestamped glyphs.

**Spaces Mirrored:**

- `trapped_in_a_void`: reflections from the chaos, grief, and emotional rebirth.
- `ascending_above_the_void`: awakened resolve, technical vision, and encoded alignment.

All content in this repository is verified and tracked through UCAN tokens and DID references.
